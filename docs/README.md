## Abstract
Explore the potential of integrating Virtual Reality (VR) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques to increase the effectiveness of skill training in dentistry by providing personalised instruction, assessment and formative feedback in a form and on a scale not possible in the physical world. The systems being built promise to provide dental students with an increased amount of guided practice at a relatively low cost.

## Related works
### 1. **The system (Web-SP)**

Web-SP (Web-based Simulation of Patients) is a general virtual patient (VP) simulation system developed at Karolinska Institutet, Sweden (14, 18).
Twenty-four VPs were created by the senior course director using the Web-SP built-in web-based authoring environment.

Web-SP is divided into the following sections:
- patient introduction
- patient interview
- physical examination
- labs/X-rays
- diagnosis
- therapy
- feedback

There are two types of feedback available to students in WebSP:
- constructive

Constructive feedback is an automatically generated checklist that matches and compares student recommendations to expert recommendations. Constructive feedback is provided for students’ activities in the explorative phase of the case review and for parts of students’ periodontal, caries registration, endodontic diagnostic activity.

- neutral

Neutral feedback is an automatically generated display of expert opinion and recommendations but does not provide any comparison between students and experts.

### 2.  **Virtual World Problem**

#### Features
- Student is virtually present as avtar.
- Clinical room is virtually made with virtual patient.
- Concurrent group practicals can be held.
- Chat feature to chat with the patient.
- Selection menus when using the equipment.
- Tutor with a case-specific guide.

#### Feedbacks

- Equipment usage : For selected item, give drop down list choose the action and done that by simulator. Then display the result.
Interact with the patient.
- Typed questions can be asked from the patient and system will reply in the chat.

#### Technologies

##### Second Life (SL) (20) by Linden Labs
- Second Life is an online multimedia platform that allows people to create an avatar for themselves and have a second life in an online virtual world.
- The platform principally features 3D-based user-generated content.
- A range of easy-to-use construction tools and a scripting language are provided by the publicly available software for the creation and editing of content in an environment
     
##### Chatbot

- For virtual patients,  through typed chat using “chatbot” functionality, “touchpoints” to initiate examinations, and equipment within the environment.
      
##### Holodeck tool

- For concurrent paracticals:
  - allowed to build both scenarios once only but replicate this in multiple locations
  - Holodeck tool in secondlife: allows you to rez a large variety of rooms or scenarios in limited space
